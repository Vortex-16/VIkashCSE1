Repository overview and quick index

- Project: Collection of DSA and Python practice files, exercises, and notes.
- Top-level files/folders:
  - `heelo.py`
  - `DSA/` — C implementations and markdown notes for data structures & algorithms
  - `Python/` — Python practice (Lists, Strings, Tuples, Dictionaries, Classes, etc.)
  - `With_RAJ/` — small TypeScript file

  **Python Folder**

  - **Description:**: Collection of Python practice scripts and exercises grouped by topic (Lists, Strings, Tuples, Dictionaries, Classes, Functions, and small games).
  - **Notable subfolders:**: `Python/List/`, `Python/String/`, `Python/Dictionaries/`, `Python/Tuples/`, `Python/Functions/`, `Python/Class/`, `Python/GAME/`.
  - **How to run a script:**: Use `python3` from the repository root, for example:

    ```bash
    python3 Python/Dictionaries/Basic.py
    python3 Python/List/ClassWork/list1.py
    ```
  - **Tips:**: Many files are small exercise scripts — run them individually to see outputs. If you want, I can add a small index file that lists runnable examples and descriptions.

Notes:
- This README was created because no README was present; it contains a brief summary and the latest update date.
- If you want a more detailed README (installation, usage, examples, contribution guide), tell me what sections to add and I will expand it.
