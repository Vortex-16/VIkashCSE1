# 14. Write a Python program using function which checks whether a year is a leap year or not.

# Example calls
print(f"Is 2000 a leap year? {is_leap_year(2000)}") # Divisible by 400
print(f"Is 1900 a leap year? {is_leap_year(1900)}") # Divisible by 100 but not 400

# Output:
# Is 2000 a leap year? True
